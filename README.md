# Global_Minimum-Simulated_Annealing
The main goal of this experiment is to compute the global minimum value of several multidimensional benchmark functions.

Consult **Paper.pdf** to see the contents of the experiment.  

This paper describes an **Iterative Hill Climbing** algorithm that also uses the **Simulated Annealing** heuristic.

The source code written for this experiment is in the **src** directory.
